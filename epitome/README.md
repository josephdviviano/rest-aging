# EPItome-xl

This is the source code for the York University MRI Pipeline. Mostly written by Joseph D Viviano 2013-2014. It lives on a kindly gentlecomputer named Harford, but could be ported to live on another server with minimal effort.

## Quick Start
This project depends on the following free software: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, nibabel, AFNI, FSL, & sun grid engine.

+ `git clone` this repository to a directory of your choosing.
+ Edit `config` to point to your EPItome-xl directory and your MRI data directory.
+ Intstall using `easy_install epitome`.
+ Add some MRI data to your data directory.
+ Check your work using `epitome check <experiment>`.
+ Generate some pre-processing scripts using `epitome run`.

## Detailed Instructions
Please see the `.pdf` under /doc for all of the gory details, and contact joseph.d.viviano@gmail.com with any questions. Enjoy the science!
